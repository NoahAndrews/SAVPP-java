# SAVPP-java
Java library for the Synchronized Audio/Video Playback Protocol. I'm developing this protocol to be used in [this project.](https://github.com/NoahAndrews/SynchronizedMediaPlayer)

## Links
* General notes about how the protocol will work can be found in [NOTES.md.](NOTES.md)
* A WIP list of protocol messages can be found [here.](https://github.com/NoahAndrews/SAVPP-java/wiki/Messages) 

## Building
To build this, you will need to install protobuf-java into your local maven repository.
